Hello teams!

We're less than a month from the challenge releases for FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg; League and FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg; League Jr., can you believe it!? Don't forget to check [past emails]() and the [FAQ]().

## Dates

We've added a page listing currently scheduled events and reserved dates for both programs. You can find those dates [here]().

Be aware that many details have not been finalized. As we do, though, that page will be updated to reflect the changes.

## Core Values

For our new-comers (or those who want a refresher), FIRST has a set of Core Values. They're our Core Values because they are central to what we do and how we achieve our goals.

They are:
- **Discovery**. We explore new skills and ideas.
- **Innovation**. We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
- **Impact**. We apply what we learn to improve our world.
- **Inclusion**. We respect each other and embrace our differences.
- **Teamwork**. We are stronger when we work together.
- **Fun**. We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

As you work through your season, make sure that you emphasize, encourage, and incorporate the Core Values with your team, in team meetings and at events, as well as outside the team.

The Core Values help push us toward one of the goals of FIRST, paraphrased by FIRST Founder Dean Kamen:
    
    “We’re not using kids to build robots, we’re using robots to build kids.”

## FIRST LEGO League Jr.

If you haven't checked out the FIRST website lately, their landing page for [FIRST LEGO League Jr.](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/flljr) can quickly link you to some useful information, updated as the season goes on. There's also some **old** information (as of 7 July) on the [challenge page](http://www.juniorfirstlegoleague.org/challenge), but it will get updated for the challenge release. Just be aware the MISSION MOON<sup>SM</sup> is **last year's** challenge and BOOMTOWN BUILD<sup>SM</sup> is **this year's** challenge. We'll also provide more information following the challenge release.

Some reminders about your team as you plan for the season:
- Your team requires two Lead Coach/Mentors at least 18 years old to register in the FIRST Dashboard and pass screening.
- Year team requires students! Remember that no single team can have more than six students *total*. So if you have seven students, but three of them are only part-time members, they still count against your six, so you'll need a second team.
- There is an age limit. Students must be at least six years old (but this is a soft restriction - kids can play up!). Students must be no older than 10 years old. If a student was 10 years old on January 1, 2019, he/she *is* eligible! If a student was 11 years old on January 1, 2019, he/she **is not** eligible.
- To get a feel for the kinds of things teams have been asked to do in prior seasons, take a look at the [past challenges page](http://www.juniorfirstlegoleague.org/past-challenges). I might recommend walking through an old challenge with your partner coaches, other mentors, other teachers, or even your team before seeing the new challenge!
